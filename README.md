# c-bebop-drone
A pure C library client for controlling Parrot Bebop Drone quadcopters.

It's based on the sample coming from Parrot.


## Dependencies
ncurses-dev

## Usage
Clone the code inside your Samples/ directory of SDK3 provided by Bebop.

These installation guide is provided for GNU/Linux and Mac OS X.

To compile:
```make```

To run: 
```make run```

To Clean: ```make clean```

## Still yet to be completed...
This code is currently being used as a part of my master thesis.
More details about my work in progress can be found [here](www.slideshare.net/daqo/masters-thesis-proposal-david-qorashi).

The official Parrot ArDrone SDK v3 is poorly documented with little sample code provided for how to use the API. As the first step I am creating a C library to make it convenient to write programs for the drone. In the next stage, I will create a high level API using a high level language (Probably Javascript or Ruby). 

Stay Tuned.
